Founded in June 2018, Tranquil Data is a seed-stage, venture backed company building enterprise software in the heart of Downtown Boston. We're tackling one of the fundamental next-generation systems challenges: understanding how data is used and enforcing that use is as-intended. Core to our values is passion and conviction that to scale technology and unlock the value in our data we must have transparent methods for governing access. This can only be done by building contextual models and using those models to bridge business requirements to technical implementation.

At out heart, that means we're tackling hard questions about graphs, databases, distributed systems, policy and least privilege, analytics, and automation. There's a blockchain in there too. Our core team draws on more than 50 years of collective enterprise software experience. We're grateful and thrilled to be backed by local Boston venture groups that get our passion and share our conviction: [Hyperplane](https://hyperplane.vc/), [First Star](http://www.firststar.vc/) and PBJ Capital.

## Sound Fun? ##

Tranquil Data was co-founded by two friends & college classmates who had independently witnessed first-hand the need from customers. We've been building a small, experienced team with a similar perspective. If youâ€™re a software developer in the Boston area thrilled about this space and excited to tackle fun systems challenges in a modern development environment, **we're hiring** and would love to hear from you! We're building a great company, and besides benefits, equity and all the fruit water you can drink, we have some awesome projects that we want you to own &amp; put your mark on.
