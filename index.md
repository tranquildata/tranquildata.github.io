excerpt: "Software that ensures data is used as-intended."

As your business scales, technology evolves &amp; data is used in new ways. How do you know that your data is being used correctly? Lawyers or Compliance Officers define the business rules; developers build and maintain implementations. What bridges the gap, and how do you operate at scale without mis-handling data? Perhaps more critically, how do you operationalize identity or intention?

Tranquil Data is proactive software that builds a meta-data model about your data, providing history and context. Using that model, you write operational policies which define your business requirements. These are focused on challenges around data flow, like enforcing user-isolation or sharing through logical segmentation. The software is transparent to applications, so you try a policy quickly to learn the behavior of your applications in development, and then move from validation in test to enforcement in production over time.
