As your business scales, technology evolves &amp; data is used in new ways. How do you know that your data is being used correctly? Lawyers or Compliance Officers define the business rules, while developers build and maintain implementations. What bridges the gap, and how do you operate at scale without mis-handling data use?

Tranquil Data is proactive software that builds a meta-data model about your data, providing history and context. Using that model, you write operational policies which define business requirements focused on data flow challenges like user-isolation or logical segmentation. You can start using these policies immediately to learn the behavior of your applications in development, and then move from validation in test to enforcement in production.
